Growl-Pushover
=========================

An action style for [Growl](http://growl.info/) 2.0 and higher that forwards [Growl](http://growl.info/) notifications to the [Pushover](http://pushover.net/) notification service.

The features of this action style include:

*   Choose to forward to [Pushover](http://pushover.net/) only when your Mac is idle
*   Choose to forward to [Pushover](http://pushover.net/) only when a notification has a minimum priority
*   Choose custom notification sounds for individual notification types
*   Add a prefix to Notification titles to differentiate configurations or Macs.
*   Push only to a specific [Pushover](http://pushover.net/) registered device.
*   Define your own custom application key.

A compiled and supported binary of Growl-Pushover is available at [http://jedda.me/projects/pushover-action-growl/](http://jedda.me/projects/pushover-action-growl/)
